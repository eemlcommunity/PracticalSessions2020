**Materials for the unsupervised tutorial at EEML 2020**

**Authors**: David Szepesvari and Stanislaw Jastrzebski

**Description**:
Unsupervised learning and generative models are key building blocks of machine learning systems. The tutorial covers a specific class of unsupervised models called autoencoders. We implement and train three variants: the original vanilla autoencoder, variational autoencoder, and time permitting/as homework the recently introduced regularized autoencoders. Along with training these, we examine and investigate the generative modeling capabilities of these three variants. All exercises will be implemented using Jax and haiku.
